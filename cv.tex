{\huge Projects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Zalo AI Challenge - Traffic Sign Detection | Leader | 1/11/2020 - 1/12/2020
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Traffic Sign Detection is an important component in autonomous systems such as drones and self-driving cars. The detection module must be fast and accurate because subsequent decisions are planned and executed based on the outputs of this system.
          \item Team size: 4 member
          \item Responsibility:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Analyze the training dataset and chooes model to work with this problem. Building the network model to fit the dataset.
            \end{itemize}
          \item Tech stacks:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item YOLOv4

      \end{itemize}
    \item Cart-pole Game | Leader | 20/08/2020 - 20/9/2020
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Cartpole - known also as an Inverted Pendulum is a pendulum with a center of gravity above its pivot point. Itâ€™s unstable, but can be controlled by moving the pivot point under the center of mass. The goal is to keep the cartpole balanced by applying appropriate forces to a pivot point.
          \item Team size: 1 member
          \item Responsibility:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Creating an agent that is capable of learning through trial and error and ultimately solving the cartpole problem.
